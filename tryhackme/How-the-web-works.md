# World Wide Web Lab – TryHackMe

Platform: TryHackMe  
Date Completed: 10.02.2026  
Skill Level: Beginner / Foundation  
Focus Area: Web Fundamentals  

## Objective

Gain a foundational understanding of how the web works, including:

- Client-server architecture
- HTTP request/response cycle
- DNS resolution
- Browser-server communication 

## Key Concepts Learned

- Client-Server Model: Browsers (clients) send requests to servers, which respond with content.
- HTTP Requests & Responses: Understanding methods like GET, POST, and response codes (200, 404, etc.).
- DNS Resolution: Translating domain names into IP addresses for routing requests.
- Browser-Server Interaction: How browsers render content and handle scripts.

## Actions Taken

- Completed the lab exercises step by step on TryHackMe.
- Documented key concepts in my notes.
- Explored tools like curl and browser developer tools to observe HTTP traffic.
- Answered quiz questions to reinforce understanding.

## Tools Used

- Web browser (Chrome)
- TryHackMe platform
- Browser Developer Tools (Network tab)
- curl (command-line HTTP requests)

## Security Relevance

Understanding web fundamentals is essential for:
- Web application security testing
- Recognizing normal vs malicious HTTP traffic
- Debugging web-based vulnerabilities 

## Lessons Learned

- Web communication is request-response based.
- DNS translates human-friendly domains into IP addresses.
- Browser tools are essential for observing network activity.
- Even foundational knowledge is critical before diving into security testing.
