# Operating System Basics – TryHackMe

Platform: TryHackMe  
Date Completed: 23.03.2026  
Skill Level: Beginner / Foundation  
Focus Area: Cybersecurity Fundamentals

## Objective

Gain a foundational understanding of operating systems and cybersecurity, including:

- Core functions of operating systems (process, memory, and file management)
- Differences between Windows and Linux environments
- Use of command-line interfaces (CLI) in both systems
- Basic security principles, including the CIA triad
- User roles and privilege levels (standard user vs administrator/root)
- Introduction to privilege escalation in controlled environments

## Key Concepts
1. Introduction to Operating Systems
- Definition and purpose of an operating system
- Role as an interface between hardware and user applications
- Core functions: process management, memory management, file systems, and device control

2. Windows Basics
- Short history and evolution of Windows from Ms-Dos to Windows 1.0 (1985)
- Understanding the desktop environment, taskbar, and file explorer
- File system navigation and management
- Basic system settings and configuration

3. Linux Fundamentals
- Understanding Linux distributions and terminal-based interaction
- File system hierarchy (/, /home, /etc, /var, /bin, /tmp)
- Permissions model (read, write, execute)

4. Command Line Interface (CLI)
**Windows CLI (Command Prompt / PowerShell)**
- Navigation & File Inspection:
cd – change directory
dir – list files and directories
dir /s – list all files recursively
type – display file contents
- System Identification:
whoami – display current user
hostname – show system name
- File Operations:
copy – copy files
move – move/rename files
del – delete files
- System & Network Information:
ipconfig – view network configuration
tasklist – view running processes
systeminfo – detailed system information
**Linux CLI**
- Navigation & File Inspection:
cd – change directory
ls – list files and directories
pwd – show current directory
cat – display file contents
find – search for files and directories
- System Investigation:
whoami – display current user
uname – system/kernel information
df -h – disk usage in human-readable format
- File Operations:
cp – copy files
mv – move/rename files
rm – remove files
touch – create files

5. Operating System Security
- **CIA Triad**:
    - Confidentiality: Protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access
    - Integrity: Ensuring data is accurate and unmodified
    - Availability: Ensing systems and data are accessible when needed
- User roles and privilege levels:
    - Differences between standard users and administrator/root accounts
    - Importance of least privilege in reducing attack surface
- Vulnerabilities & Misconfigurations:
    - Weak passwords and poor authentication practices
    - Incorrect file permissions leading to unauthorized access
    - Misconfigured services and exposed system files
    - Risks posed by malicious or untrusted programs
- Privilege Escalation (Practical Exposure):
    - Basic understanding of how attackers exploit misconfigurations to gain elevated privileges
    - Hands-on experience in controlled environments (e.g., AttackBox labs)

## Actions Taken
- Explored Windows environment, including file management and system settings
- Practiced Linux commands in a terminal environment
- Executed common CLI commands for navigation, file manipulation, and system monitoring
- Used a virtualized lab environment (AttackBox) to simulate real-world scenarios
- Performed privilege escalation exercises to gain root/administrator access in a controlled environment
- Applied CIA triad concepts to understand system security risks

## Tools Used
- Windows Operating System
- Linux (terminal-based environment)
- Command Prompt and PowerShell
- Bash shell
- AttackBox (cloud-based virtual machine for penetration testing labs)

## Security Relevance
This project supports the development of foundational cybersecurity skills by building a better understanding of how operating systems function and how they can be secured.

- Understanding how operating systems function is critical for identifying vulnerabilities
- CLI proficiency enables efficient system interaction and incident response
- Knowledge of permissions and user roles is key to preventing unauthorized access
- Practical exposure to privilege escalation highlights common attack vectors
- Applying the CIA triad provides a framework for evaluating and improving system security

These skills provide a starting point for further development towards roles such as SOC Analyst, Security Engineer, or Penetration Tester.
