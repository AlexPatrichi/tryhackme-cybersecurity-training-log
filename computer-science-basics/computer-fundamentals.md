# Computer Fundamentals Lab – TryHackMe  

Platform: TryHackMe  
Date Completed: 26.02.2026  
Skill Level: Beginner / Foundation   
Focus Area: Computer Fundamentals  

## Objective

Build a foundational understanding of modern computing systems, from physical hardware to cloud infrastructure, including:
- System architecture
- Boot processes
- Computer types and usage models
- Client–server communication
- Virtualisation
- Cloud computing

## Key Concepts Learned

- **System architecture (hardware + peripherals)**
Structure of physical components and how they interact as a single system.
- **Boot process (UEFI/BIOS firmware → OS)**
Transition from powered hardware to a running operating system.
- **Computer types and usage models**
Different device classes designed for different workloads and purposes.
- **Client–server & HTTP communication**
Request–response model where clients consume services from servers, implemented via HTTP with methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- **Virtualisation principles**
Running multiple isolated systems on shared physical hardware through hypervisors that manage virtual CPU, memory, storage, and network resources.
- **Cloud computing fundamentals**
On-demand computing resources delivered over the internet.

## Actions Taken

- Completed the Computer Fundamentals module on TryHackMe
