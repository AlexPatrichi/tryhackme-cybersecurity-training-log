# Cybersecurity Training Portfolio

I am a cybersecurity student building hands-on experience through labs, SOC simulations, and practical exercises.  
This repository documents my technical learning, lab work, and applied cybersecurity training.

---

## Focus Areas

- SOC operations & security monitoring  
- Log analysis & incident response  
- SIEM tools & alert triage  
- Web & network security fundamentals  
- Tools & scripting for automation  
- Version control and technical documentation  

---

## Purpose

This portfolio shows my progression from foundational learning to applied skills. Each folder contains structured write-ups and notes from platforms like TryHackMe, labs, and personal projects. It is designed to demonstrate practical skills and capability in cybersecurity roles, and also serves as a hands-on exercise in using Git and GitHub for version control, collaboration, and documenting cybersecurity labs.

## Repository Structure

/tryhackme
→ Each TryHackMe room gets its own markdown file documenting learning outcomes, concepts, and security relevance

/git-basics
→ Git, Bash, and GitHub learning notes, workflows, and version control practice

---

## How to Navigate

1. Start with `/tryhackme/` for foundational lab exercises.  
2. Each lab file includes: objective, key concepts, actions taken, tools used, and security relevance.  
3. This repository will grow as more labs and exercises are added.
